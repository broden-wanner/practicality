# Frontend

The app itself is an [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) app. Ionic apps are written in
JavaScript, using a framework like Angular or React, that build on the Cordova mobile
framework. This allows the app to be built from one codebase and work on the web, iOS,
and Android.

At the moment, the app is in alpha and is only available over web. The web frontend is
hosted on the same DigitalOcean droplet as the backend and is just served up as
static files using Nginx.
