# Welcome to the Practicality Docs!

These are the docs for developing on Practicality, which is a yapa (yet another practice app)
but for the short- and long-term. It encourages you to practice everyday and keep notes on your
progress. You can keep track of your projects in a sensible and stepwise manner while also
keeping up with your daily practice habits.

This app is still in its alpha phase. It is not deployed to the App Store or Google Play but
is available at [practicality.brodenwanner.com](https://practicality.brodenwanner.com) for
preview. Find out how to contribute on the [contributing](contributing.md) section of the docs.

The app itself is an [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) app. Ionic apps are written in
JavaScript, using a framework like Angular or React, that build on the Cordova mobile
framework. This allows the app to be built from one codebase and work on the web, iOS,
and Android. See the [frontend](frontend.md) docs for more info on how the frontend app
is developed.

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is used for the backend REST API with the help
of the popular [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). It provides
relatively simple endpoints for accessing and creating data along with managing
the user accounts and authentication. See the [backend](backend.md) docs for more info.

The source code can be found on the [github repo](https://github.com/broden-wanner/practicality)
for this project.
