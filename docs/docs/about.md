# About Practicality

This app was an independent project developed by
[Broden Wanner](https://brodenwanner.com) to try to combine
interests of software development and music. A horn and piano player, he
saw an opportunity for something that would help track his progress and
long-term goals while still keeping the short-term in mind.

At the moment, the app is still in alpha and is not hosted on Google Play or
the App Store. However, you can preview the current build at https://practicality.brodenwanner.com
(it is recommended that you view on mobile or with devtools).
For a list of features, see the [features](features.md) section for what features there
are and future work.

If you have any suggestions or issues with the app, please create an feature request or
issue on the [github repo](https://github.com/broden-wanner/practicality).

This app was made using the cross-platfrom app development framework Ionic and uses a
backend created with Django. If you have any interest in contributing, please reach out to
me at [brodenwanner@gmail.com](mailto:brodenwanner@gmail.com).
