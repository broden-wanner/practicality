          This app was an independent project developed by
          <a href="https://brodenwanner.com">Broden Wanner</a>
          to try to combine interests of software development and music. A horn and piano player, he
          saw an opportunity for something that would help track his progress and long-term goals
          while still keeping the short-term in mind.
